# Regularization and how does it reduce overfitting

# Logistic Regression

# Machine Learning

# ML: kNN

# ML: DT/RF

# ML: Bayes

# PCA:

# Ridge regression vs Lasso:
## When do we desire l-1 and when do we desire l2: It dependes on the geometric shape.

# Gradient descent:
## Gradient is the derivative of a multivariate function

# Jacobian Hessian
## 1st-order 2nd-order derivative of a vector
