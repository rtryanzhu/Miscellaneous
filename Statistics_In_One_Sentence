# What's statistics/probability?
Evaluate the likelihood/possibility of an event given known information such as experiment results.

# Moments in statistics
Moments are used to describe some characteristics of distributions

# MGF
MGF is used to find the n-th order moment, by taking the n-th order derivative of MGF at t=0, you get the n-th moment

# Regularization and how does it reduce overfitting

# Logistic Regression

# Machine Learning

# ML: kNN

# ML: DT/RF

# ML: Bayes

# PCA:

# Ridge regression vs Lasso:
## When do we desire l-1 and when do we desire l2: It dependes on the geometric shape.

# Gradient descent:
## Gradient is the derivative of a multivariate function

# Jacobian Hessian
## 1st-order 2nd-order derivative of a vector
