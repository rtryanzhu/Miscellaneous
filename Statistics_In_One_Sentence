# What's statistics/probability?
Evaluate the likelihood/possibility of an event given known information such as experiment results.

# What is regression?
Estimate the relationships between a dependent variable and independent variable(s).

# Logistic Regression
When the dependent variable is binary, it models the probability by log-odds of a set of variables. logit(p)=log(p/(1-p))

# Moments in statistics
Moments are used to describe some characteristics of distributions

# MGF
MGF is used to find the n-th order moment, by taking the n-th order derivative of MGF at t=0, you get the n-th moment

# Normal distribution

# Familiy of distribution
Members of a distribution family have similar patterns, such as Skewenss-Kurtosis plots for Gamma, Neg-Gamma and Normal.

# Regularization and how does it reduce overfitting



# Machine Learning

# ML: kNN

# ML: DT/RF
Split rules: (1) Var reduction (2) Information gain (With entropy defined as \sum{pi log(pi)} (3) Gini Impurity (4) Chi-square

# ML: Bayes

# PCA:

# Ridge regression vs Lasso:
## When do we desire l-1 and when do we desire l2: It dependes on the geometric shape.

# Gradient descent:
## Gradient is the derivative of a multivariate function

# Jacobian Hessian
## 1st-order 2nd-order derivative of a vector
